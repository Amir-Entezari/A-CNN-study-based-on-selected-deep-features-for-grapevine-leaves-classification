## Data Set
The dataset that is considered in this project is about to recognition of the types of grape leaves.In addition to the fruit of the grape tree, the leaves of the grape tree can also be used and based on its type, its price and use are determined. It is not possible to separate these leaves manually on a large scale.Therefore, we try to do the sorting of leaves automatically with the data we have.
### Step 1
In this step we are going to split the data into training and test data with a ratio of 80 to 20.
For this purpose, we load the data first. We have a zip file that must first be downloaded and then extracted. Since the project is going to be placed in google colab, we save the data in a temporary folder.
